## Introduction

The **[Project Name] Compiler** is a [insert language(s)] compiler designed to [brief description of the compiler's purpose]. It translates [language name] source code into [output (e.g., machine code, bytecode, intermediate representation)] and includes optimizations for [specific features or targets].

### Team

- Willie Dietrich
- Geoffrey Streich
- Casey Cronin
- Wilson Rogahn DVM

### Why use [Project Name]?

- Fast and efficient compilation
- Support for [languages or standards]
- [Any unique features or goals]

## Features

- **Cross-platform:** Runs on [list of supported platforms]
- **Optimization:** Implements advanced optimizations like [list of optimizations: e.g., constant folding, dead code elimination]
- **Error Reporting:** Detailed syntax and semantic error messages
- **[Other features]**

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **[Language/Tool Version(s)]:** Ensure you have [required language/tools] installed.

#### Example:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install [required-dependencies]
```

### Installing the Compiler

Clone the repository and install any required dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://gibson.telecomnancy.univ-lorraine.fr/projets/2425/compil/[project-name].git
$ cd [project-name]
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

## Usage

### Basic Command

To compile a [language] source file:

```bash
$ [project-name] [options] [source-file]
```

### Command-line Options

- `-o [file]`: Specify output file name
- `-O`: Enable optimizations
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode
- `--help`: Show help message

### Examples

#### Compiling a simple program:

```bash
$ [project-name] -o output.exe example.lang
```

#### Running in debug mode:

```bash
$ [project-name] --debug example.lang
```

## Examples

Here are some sample programs you can compile using [Project Name]:

1. **Hello World:**

```language
// Example code for Hello World in [language]
```

2. **Fibonacci Sequence:**

```language
// Example code for Fibonacci in [language]
```

For more examples, refer to the `examples/` directory.

## Testing

To run tests, make sure you have [testing framework] installed:

```bash
$ make test
```

You can also add specific test cases in the `tests/` folder and run them with:

```bash
$ ./run_tests.sh
```
